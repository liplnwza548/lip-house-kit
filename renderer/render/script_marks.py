"""v1.1 T4+T5: Thai mark detection (overlays RETIRED 2026-09-24) + content QA.

T4 was the Layer1 ``thai_mark_fix`` compensation layer. C6 30-frame QA +
isolated render tests proved the overlay layer itself CAUSED tofu/float
(run-splitting isolates marks from their base); plain unsplit Prompt Bold
shapes stacked marks correctly on the current ffmpeg+libass build.
``build_overlays`` is now a no-op (ENABLE_OVERLAYS=False); detection
(``count_stacked``) is kept for QA reporting. Do NOT re-enable without
re-verifying on real burned frames.

Single-mark cues are a no-op (no overlays, base text unchanged) — proven
by the thai_mark_fix helpers this wraps (no reimplementation here).

(Historical mechanism, retired: the layer used to (1) hide the broken
inline mark glyph in the main line and (2) emit one Layer1 overlay
Dialogue per stacked cluster. Kept here for audit only.)

T5 content QA (fail or flag clearly, before burn):

- ``assert_no_overlap``: adjacent (sub-)cues must be monotonic
  (next.start >= prev.end - epsilon). Trimmable overlaps should go
  through ``script_timing.trim_overlaps`` first (``build_ass`` does
  this automatically); what the trim cannot save still refuses loudly.
- ``assert_no_zero_duration``: every cue has start < end.
- ``assert_all_fit``: re-export of the T1 width gate for QA call sites.
- ``count_stacked``: stacked-cluster count in a text (spot-check QA).
